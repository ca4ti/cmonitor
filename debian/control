# ABOUT LIBFMT:
# VERSION: cmonitor-collector debian package is built on 'old' Ubuntu distributions like Ubuntu Bionic 18.04
#          which ships an old libfmt-dev package version 4.0.0, see 
#             https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/amd64/libfmt-dev/filelist
#          so make sure not to use any new feature available only in libfmt > 4.0.0 !
# RUNTIME: libfmt-dev provides a static library so that it's just a "Build-Depends" and not a "Depends": at runtime
#          there's no need of that package being installed
Build-Depends: debhelper (>=10), libgtest-dev, libbenchmark-dev, libfmt-dev
Standards-Version: 4.0.0
