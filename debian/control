# IMPORTANT NOTE: cmonitor-collector debian package is built on 'old' Ubuntu distributions like Ubuntu Bionic 18.04
#                 which ship an old libfmt-dev package version 4.0.0, see 
#                   https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/amd64/libfmt-dev/filelist
#                 so make sure not to use any new feature available only in libfmt > 4.0.0 !
